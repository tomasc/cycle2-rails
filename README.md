# DEPRECATED:

This solution is replaced by [Rails Assets](https://rails-assets.org) and the `rails-assets-jquery-cycle2` gem.

# Cycle2-Rails

Integrates [jquery.cycle2.js](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2) with the Rails asset pipeline.

Cycle2 is a versatile slideshow plugin for jQuery built around ease-of-use. It supports a declarative initialization style that allows full customization without any scripting. Simply include the plugin, declare your markup, and Cycle2 does the rest.

Cycle2 was written by Mike Alsup. 

# For Rails 3.1+ only (including Rails 4)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cycle2-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

In your application.js

Additionaly you can use optional Cycle2 plugins like this:
